# Fluid simulator
This is a simple (in progress) fluid simulator made in python. 

## Running the simulation
Make sure all the files are present. In the file `parameters.py`, certain parameters can be changed such as the size of the grid and the velocity field. Run the file `fluid_sim` to start the simulation. There are a lot of controls in order to use the simulation to its maximum potential:

### Keyboard:
- Press "1" for left wall, "2" for top wall, "3" for right wall, "4" for bottom wall
- Press "Esc" to exit the simulation
- Press "C" to remove all fluid
- Press "D" to increase the velocity
- Press "Space" to pause the simulation
- Press "I" to get information about the flow
- Press "H" to toggle the velocity field

### Mouse:
- Click left mouse button to spawn fluid
- Click right mouse button to spawn a obstacle
