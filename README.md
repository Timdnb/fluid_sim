# Fluid simulator
This is a simple (in progress) Fluid simulator made in python

## Running the simulation
Make sure all the files are present. In the file `parameters.py`, certain parameters can be changed such as the size of the grid and the velocity field. Run the file `fluid_sim` and click anywhere in the field to create the fluid.
